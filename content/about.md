# about
Hello! My name is Violet Purcell, also known as vimproved online (or sometimes
just vi). At the time of writing, I am 17 years old and have just graduated from
Interlochen Arts Academy as a Music Composition major. Aside from music, I often
contribute to open-source projects on the side (primarily Gentoo).
