# about
Hello! My name is Violet Purcell, also known as vimproved online (or sometimes
just vi). At the time of writing, I am 18 years old and am currently studying
Music Composition at Interlochen Arts Academy. Aside from music, I often
contribute to open-source projects on the side (primarily Gentoo).
